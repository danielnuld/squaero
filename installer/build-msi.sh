# Build the Squaero Windows MSI (issue #40). Reproducible, no CI required.
#
# Prerequisites (one-time):
#   dotnet tool install --global wix          # WiX CLI (v5+)
#   wix extension add -g WixToolset.UI.wixext # the WixUI dialog set
#
# The release is x86 (32-bit). The IBM Informix ODBC driver forced that until
# issue #557 (Informix is now reached over DRDA, with no IBM client at all);
# moving to x64 is a change of its own.
#
# Staging: build-x86/app/ must contain the app + its runtime DLLs + drivers/.
# Build it first with the i686 toolchain (see cmake/toolchain-i686-mingw.cmake).
# The MySQL client (32-bit MariaDB Connector/C), SSH (libssh2) and MongoDB
# (mongo-c-driver) are all fetched and built from source by CMake — no manual
# client library needed:
#   pnpm --dir frontend build
#   cmake -S . -B build-x86 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-i686-mingw.cmake \
#     -DQUAERO_SSH=ON -DQUAERO_MARIADB=ON -DQUAERO_MONGOC=ON
#   cmake --build build-x86 --target quaero
# The CMake staging places the driver plugins and the MinGW runtime DLLs next to
# squaero.exe automatically (the MariaDB client is linked statically into
# mysql.dll, so there is no separate client DLL to ship).
#
# Usage: installer/build-msi.sh [version]   (default: ./VERSION)

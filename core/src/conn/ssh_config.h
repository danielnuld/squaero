/*
 * SSH-tunnel configuration parsed from a connection DSN.
 *
 * The tunnel is engine-agnostic: any network driver can be reached through it.
 * The core reads the ssh_* fields from the DSN, opens a local port-forward to
 * the database BEFORE handing a (rewritten) DSN to the driver, and the driver
 * connects to 127.0.0.1:<local_port> none the wiser. This module is the pure,
 * I/O-free parser/validator for those fields; it allocates owned copies of the
 * strings and the caller disposes them.
 *
 * Recognised DSN fields (all optional unless noted):
 *   ssh_host            SSH server host. Its PRESENCE is what turns tunnelling
 *                       on; absent => not a tunnelled connection.
 *   ssh_port            SSH server port (default 22).
 *   ssh_user            SSH username (required when ssh_host is present).
 *   ssh_auth            "password" | "key" | "agent" (default "agent").
 *   ssh_password        password for ssh_auth=password (required for it).
 *   ssh_key             path to a private key for ssh_auth=key.
 *   ssh_private_key     the key itself (PEM/OpenSSH text) instead of a path, for
 *                       apps that keep it in a secret store, not on disk (iOS
 *                       Keychain). Takes precedence over ssh_key; one of the two
 *                       is required for ssh_auth=key.
 *   ssh_key_passphrase  optional passphrase protecting ssh_key.
 *   ssh_target_host     forward target host (default: the DSN "host", or
 *                       127.0.0.1 when the DSN has none).
 *   ssh_target_port     forward target port (default: the DSN "port", or 0,
 *                       which the driver resolves to its engine default).
 *   ssh_host_key_policy "accept-new" | "strict" | "off" (default "accept-new").
 *                       accept-new = TOFU: an unknown host key is accepted and
 *                       recorded, but a CHANGED key is rejected (MITM). strict =
 *                       reject unknown keys too. off = no verification (legacy).
 *   ssh_known_hosts     path to the known_hosts store (default ~/.ssh/known_hosts).

/* Protocol version negotiated by the `app.hello` handshake.
   v2 added the M1 data path (conn.open / conn.close / query.run + -32000..).
   v3 adds schema introspection: schema.tree / schema.describe / schema.ddl.
   v4 adds transaction control: tx.begin / tx.commit / tx.rollback.
   v5 adds row editing: row.insert / row.update / row.delete.
   v6 adds offset pagination to query.run (params.offset).
   v7 adds op.cancel: interrupt a running query from the frontend.
   v8 adds cursor paging: query.run accepts params.cursor and query.next /
      query.cursorClose page a result without re-running the query. */

/*
 * UTF-8 safety net for text coming back from Informix.
 *
 * The SQLI fallback asks the CSDK for UTF-8 on every connection (CLIENT_LOCALE,
 * see utils/connstr.h), so in normal operation everything here is a no-op: the
 * bytes arrive already converted and are passed through untouched. This exists
 * for the cases where that does not hold — a client or server that ignored the
 * request — because the
 * neutral contract and the JSON transport require valid UTF-8, and invalid bytes
 * used to leave the grid loading forever (issue #315).
 *
 * The fallback code set is Latin-1, which is what the driver has always assumed.
 * It cannot be inferred from the bytes: 0xC3 0xB1 is a valid UTF-8 "ñ" and an
 * equally valid Latin-1 "Ã±", and only the database knows which it meant. That is
 * why asking the engine to convert is the real fix and this is only the net.
 *
 * Every function treats its input as a NUL-terminated string.

 * NULL with `*cap` 0, and belongs to the caller to free.

 * Pure builder for the ODBC connection string passed to SQLDriverConnect.
 *
 * Two shapes are supported:
 *   - A pre-configured ODBC data source: set `odbc_dsn`; the result is
 *     "DSN=<dsn>;Uid=<user>;Pwd=<password>;" (driver/host/... are ignored).
 *   - A driver-direct connection (no sqlhosts entry needed): set `host`,
 *     `service` and `server`; the result lists DRIVER + Host/Service/Server/
 *     Protocol/Database/Uid/Pwd. `driver` defaults to the registered IBM
 *     Informix ODBC driver and `protocol` to onsoctcp.
 *
 * Values containing a delimiter ({ } ; =) or whitespace are wrapped in braces
 * per the ODBC connection-string grammar, and any literal '}' inside such a
 * value is doubled, so passwords with special characters round-trip safely.
